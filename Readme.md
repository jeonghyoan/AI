# Class Incremental Learning for Object Detection
**Project Period**: Nov 2023 - Dec 2023

This project addresses the challenges of class incremental learning in object detection, focusing on improving the recognition of new classes in robotics and autonomous driving. It explores methods to overcome limitations in adapting to new classes not present in the initial dataset while enhancing real-world applicability.<br><br>

## Key Points

- **Goal**: Enhance the recognition of new classes in object detection.<br><br>
- **Problem Statement**: Address unique difficulties and complexities in identifying multiple classes within a single image.<br><br>
- **Project Focus**: Optimize buffer training and improve replay methods for real-world scenarios.<br><br>
- **Dataset**: Utilize the MS COCO 2017 dataset, featuring over 200,000 images across 80 diverse categories.<br><br>
